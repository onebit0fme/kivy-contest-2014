Chess Scorebook

This is not a game of chess. The intention of the application is to store chess games for chess enthusiasts like myself to review and perfect chess skills.

Features:
* Add games of chess legends or you own
* Record game as you play it
* Review stored games move by move
* Menu is a game of chess

Requirements:
* None, all included

Resources used:
* Chessnut - chess board model (https://github.com/cgearhart/Chessnut.git)

The code does not include instructions or packages for any platform. Package as usual Kivy project.

Started this project on last week of the contest, so haven't got time to implement many things, like Algebraic Notation, currently the app uses only simple board indexing.

Kivy is awesome! All the best!
